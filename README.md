**Version: 1.0.0**

  

**Description:**

This repository contains the source code for a Node.js backend application named Digital Laundry. The application is designed to handle server-side tasks such as:

  

1. User authentication and authorization

2. Data storage and retrieval (potentially using MongoDB)

3. API endpoints for interacting with the data

4. Rate limiting to prevent abuse

  

**Features:**

  

1. Robust authentication: Implements secure user authentication using bcrypt or other hashing algorithms.

2. Authorization: Enforces user roles and permissions to control access to sensitive data.

3. Data management: Provides a flexible database solution (potentially MongoDB) for storing and retrieving data.

4. API endpoints: Exposes well-defined API endpoints for various functionalities.

5. Rate limiting: Integrates rate limiting using express-rate-limit against abuse.

  

**Dependencies:**

  

- bcrypt or bcryptjs for password hashing

- body-parser for parsing request bodies

- cors for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- dotenv for managing environment variables

- express for building the backend application

- express-rate-limit for rate limiting

- jsonwebtoken for generating and verifying JWTs

- mongoose (optional) for MongoDB integration

- twilio (optional) for Twilio integration

- nodemon (dev dependency) for development-time hot reloading

  
  

## **Getting Started:**

  
**Backend**



**Clone the repository:**

  

    git clone https://github.com/hashirnp/digital-laundry.git

**Change the Directory to Backend**

    cd backend

**Install dependencies:**

  

    npm install

  
  

**Configure environment variables:**

  

- Create a .env file in the project root directory.

- Add any necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).

  

**Start the development server:**

  

    npm start


Alternatively, you can use nodemon for automatic code reloading during development:

  

    npm run dev

  
  **Frontend will be added (Flutter Application)** 

**Accepting criticism without hesitation.**
